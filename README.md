# Medatimer
A progressive web app to keep track of your meditation progress. The timer is non-intrusive, beeping a single soft tone on completion. Easily reset your session time, pause, and get inspired by introspective quotes. The timer can be set using a radial control or by entering text into the input field. The app handles time abbreviations, so inputs like `1s` or `one second`, or `one s`, will always set the timer to 1 second. Medatime was designed for `mobile-first`, ensuring responsive UX on any device.
